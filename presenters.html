<h1>AISTATS*2014 Instructions for Presenters</h1>

<h2>Poster Presentations</h2>

<p>Posters should be in A0 size in portrait orientation (width 85cm, height 120cm).

<p>The poster boards have width 95cm and height 150cm. Note that the boards are
not wide enough to hold an A0 poster in landscape orientation!

<p>Please note that all papers presented as talks also have a corresponding poster presentation.

<p>We have a very high turnout for AISTATS this year, and the poster 
sessions will be somewhat crowded, so it is important to have the 
posters set up before the session starts. 
<ul>
<li>For the Tuesday session, 
presenters can set up their posters during the registration period (8:00-9:00).
Posters must be taken down by the end of the Tuesday 
paper sessions.
<li>For the Thursday session, AISTATS presenters can set up 
their posters either during the morning registration period 
or during the lunch break, and they must be removed at the 
end of the evening poster session. 
<li>For the Thursday session, MLSS student posters 
can be hung in Hvammur (see the <a href="poster_sessions.html#session2">map of the Thursday poster session layout</a>) on a first-come 
first-served basis between 15:00 and 17:00, and should be 
left mounted for the Friday poster session as well; they 
need to be taken down after the Friday poster session.
If there is not enough room for all MLSS posters in Hvammur, 
students may spill into the overflow area just outside 
the main exhibit area.
</ul>


<h2>Oral Presentations</h2>

<p>Oral presentations last 25 minutes including about 5 minutes for discussion.
<b>Please contact the session chair 15 minutes before the start of the session.</b>

<p>The hotel furnishes a computer with Windows 7, Adobe Acrobat Reader, and
Powerpoint 2010 installed. If you wish to use this common machine,
transfer the slides there during the break before your session. 

<p>If you wish to use your own laptop, try it out during the break before your 
session. You can connect to the projector using a standard VGA connector and a standard audio jack. 
We will attempt to have some adapters on-hand, but speakers should ensure that they bring any 
necessary cables needed to connect to a VGA projector.

<p>Microphones are provided (wired and wireless). We also have two wireless mics that can
be passed around for Q&amp;A. A laser pointer can also be provided.

<p>Please note that all papers presented as talks also have a corresponding poster presentation.

<p>Video recordings will be made of oral presentations; more details to be announced.
