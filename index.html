         <p>The Seventeenth international conference on Artificial
    Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2014) will be held in 
Reykjavik, Iceland.&nbsp; AISTATS is an interdisciplinary gathering of
    researchers at the intersection of computer science, artificial 
intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and related areas.&nbsp; 
Since its inception in 1985, the primary goal of AISTATS has been to 
broaden research in these fields by promoting the exchange of ideas 
among them.&nbsp; We encourage the submission of all papers which are in
 keeping with this objective.</p>
<br>


<p>The online proceedings and the abstracts of highlight talks are available through the <a href="accepted.html">Talks and Papers</a> page.
