<p>The Seventeenth international conference on Artificial
  Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2014) will be held in 
  Reykjavik, Iceland.&nbsp; AISTATS is an interdisciplinary gathering of
  researchers at the intersection of computer science, artificial 
  intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and related areas.&nbsp; 
  Since its inception in 1985, the primary goal of AISTATS has been to 
  broaden research in these fields by promoting the exchange of ideas 
among them.&nbsp; We encourage the submission of all papers which are in
  keeping with this objective.</p>


<p>The online proceedings and the abstracts of highlight talks are available through the <a href="accepted.html">Talks and Papers</a> page.
