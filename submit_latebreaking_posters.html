<p><b>Late-breaking posters track:</b> Some time at the conference will be set aside for "breaking 
news" posters having a one-page abstract. These posters may report on ongoing or unpublished projects, 
projects already published elsewhere, partially developed ideas, negative results etc, and are meant 
as informal forums to encourage discussion. 
Abstracts should summarize and highlight why the projects will be of interest to the AISTATS community. 
The review process of the late-breaking posters will be 
very light-touch and presentation at the Conference will not lead to publication in the Proceedings.

<p>Since its inception in 1985, the primary goal of AISTATS has been to broaden research at the interface 
between artificial intelligence and statistics. Abstracts on all aspects of this interface are 
strongly encouraged, including but not limited to:

<ul>
<li>Models and estimation (graphical models, causality, Gaussian processes, approximate inference, kernel methods, nonparametric models, statistical and computational learning theory, manifolds and embedding, sparsity and compressed sensing, ...)
<li>Classification, regression, density estimation, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, clustering, topic models, ...
<li>Structured prediction, relational learning, logic and probability
<li>Reinforcement learning, planning, control
<li>Game theory, no-regret learning, multi-agent systems
<li>Algorithms and architectures for high-performance computation in AI and statistics
<li>Software for and applications of AI and statistics
</ul>

<h3>Submission Requirements</h3>

<p>Electronic submission of one-page abstracts is required. The abstracts must fit one A4/letter page 
with sufficient margins and at least 10 point font size. The authors may use the proceedings track 
paper format, but this is not required. Please remember to include authors names as the reviewing is 
not double blind.

<p>Abstracts will be lightly reviewed. Acceptance notifications will be emailed by February 12th. These 
will be presented as posters at the conference but will not be published.

<p>MLSS attendees: all MLSS Reykjavik attendees get to present their
posters at the AISTATS poster session. Please do not resubmit your
poster here!
