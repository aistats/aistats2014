<p><b>Highlight talks track:</b> The Conference Programme will include talks on recent high-impact 
work on AISTATS themes. This is an opportunity to raise discussion and get additional exposure to 
work already published in journals. The talks will be selected based on one-page 
abstracts and the existing papers, and they do not lead to a paper in the Proceedings.

<p>Since its inception in 1985, the primary goal of AISTATS has been to broaden research at the interface 
between artificial intelligence and statistics. Abstracts on all aspects of this interface are 
strongly encouraged, including but not limited to:

<ul>
<li>Models and estimation (graphical models, causality, Gaussian processes, approximate inference, kernel methods, nonparametric models, statistical and computational learning theory, manifolds and embedding, sparsity and compressed sensing, ...)
<li>Classification, regression, density estimation, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, clustering, topic models, ...
<li>Structured prediction, relational learning, logic and probability
<li>Reinforcement learning, planning, control
<li>Game theory, no-regret learning, multi-agent systems
<li>Algorithms and architectures for high-performance computation in AI and statistics
<li>Software for and applications of AI and statistics
</ul>
For a more detailed list of keywords, see <a href="keywords.html">http://www.aistats.org/aistats2012/keywords.html</a>.
